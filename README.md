The app reads all SMSes from an android phone and sends it to a specifed API. The sending also happens when the app is running in the background not when the app is closed. For now it checks for a keyword in the message text before sending. 
The API base URL can be modified from the app/src/main/java/com/example/cowin/RetorfitInstance.java
The keyword can be modified from the app/src/main/java/com/example/cowin/MainActivity.java
